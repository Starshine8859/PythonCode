I hope collaborating with you.
************************************************
I'm a senior software developer based in Japan with over 10 years of experience in web, mobile, and AI development.
I've been exploring ways to grow my income and recently developed a new idea that I believe could benefit not just myself, but also skilled developers like youâ€”especially those based in the U.S. After reviewing your background on Braintrust, I felt you might be an ideal partner for this initiative.
This collaboration won't require a large time commitment. In fact, you can continue working full-time at your current job or focus on other urgent projects while participating. Your role is important, but the time investment is minimalâ€”and you'll receive consistent monthly compensation, which will increase over time.
I'd love to share more details and hear your thoughts. If you're open to a quick conversation, you can book a time that works for you here:

I am a software developer based in Japan with over 10 years of experience in web development.
Recently, I've come up with an idea that I believe can create a mutually beneficial opportunityâ€”particularly on freelancing and job search platforms. While searching for the right partner on Braintrust, your profile caught my attention, and I thought you might be interested in this collaboration.

I'm a senior software developer from Japan with over 10 years of experience in web and mobile development. Recently, I've been focusing deeply on artificial intelligenceâ€”driven by a passion for creating new and meaningful innovations.
I firmly believe that true partnership is one of the most powerful forces we have. When two people combine their talents with purpose and trust, the potential is limitless. Sadly, many developers hesitate to take that first step toward collaborationâ€”and in doing so, miss out on incredible opportunities and fall behind in this fast-moving industry.
While searching for someone bold, driven, and forward-thinking on Braintrust, I came across your profile. Your background immediately stood out to me, and I knew I would regret not reaching out to you.
I'd love to share the details of a collaboration idea that I believe could be both meaningful and mutually rewarding. Just one thing to note upfront: this opportunity won't require much of your time. Whether you're working full-time or handling other priorities, you can still take on this role comfortably.
If you're open to hearing more, please book a time that works best for you here:
